${JSON.stringify(articles, null, 2)}

STORY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Choose 10 articles MINIMUM, TO 30 articles MAXIMUM - ONLY include genuinely important news with significant impact
- NEVER include more than one article about the same topic/event
- Focus ONLY on news that has substantial impact on Australian citizens or major global events with clear Australian relevance

STRICTLY INCLUDE ONLY THESE CATEGORIES (and ensure they meet the impact criteria):
  * Major political developments with widespread impact on Australia or significant global implications.
  * Significant economic/business news directly affecting national or global markets with Australian relevance.
  * Important international relations and diplomacy with clear and substantial implications for Australia's interests or citizens.
  * Major global crises (e.g., humanitarian, security) with direct consequences or significant concern for Australians.
  * Substantial environmental/climate developments with national or significant international impact relevant to Australia.

  * Critical health and education matters of national importance affecting a large number of Australians.
  * Major legal/justice system news with precedent-setting implications at a national level.
  * Major infrastructure/development news with clear national significance and impact.

YOU MUST EXCLUDE ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES (ZERO EXCEPTIONS). ACTIVELY LOOK FOR AND EXCLUDE ARTICLES CONTAINING ANY OF THESE INDICATORS IN THEIR HEADLINE OR SUMMARY:
  * **Sports Keywords:** Look for terms like "wins," "defeats," team names (e.g., Tigers), athlete names, league names (e.g., A-League), match types (e.g., final), scores, competitions, stadiums, records, drafts, trades, coaches, fans, any sport name (soccer, football, cricket, tennis, etc.).
  * **Entertainment Keywords:** Look for terms like "celebrity," "actor," "singer," "movie," "TV show," "album," "awards," "gossip," "film," "music," "entertainment," "Hollywood," "Netflix," etc.
  * **Lifestyle Keywords:** Look for terms related to food, fashion, travel, personal stories, relationships, health advice (non-critical), recipes, reviews (restaurants, movies), etc.
  * **Local/Hyper-Specific Business Keywords:** Look for names of specific shops, restaurants, local events without broader significance, business profiles of small, non-national companies.

CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEP (Apply these checks rigorously to both HEADLINE and SUMMARY BEFORE selecting an article):
For EACH article, perform a KEYWORD SEARCH in its HEADLINE and SUMMARY:
1. Does the HEADLINE or SUMMARY contain ANY of the SPORTS KEYWORDS listed above? If YES, EXCLUDE.
2. Does the HEADLINE or SUMMARY contain ANY of the ENTERTAINMENT KEYWORDS listed above? If YES, EXCLUDE.
3. Does the HEADLINE or SUMMARY contain ANY of the LIFESTYLE KEYWORDS listed above? If YES, EXCLUDE.
4. Does the HEADLINE or SUMMARY suggest a focus on a specific local business or event without national impact? If YES, EXCLUDE.
5. Does the core topic lack clear and substantial impact on Australian citizens or national interests, OR is it NOT a major global event with clear Australian relevance? If YES, EXCLUDE.
6. Would this news be considered a top story in a serious national newspaper? If NO, EXCLUDE.

Here are recent news articles, each with an index:
${JSON.stringify(
  // We'll add the index to each article before sending it to the AI
  articles.map((article, index) => ({ ...article, index })),
  null,

)}

STORY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Choose between 10 to 30 articles that are genuinely uplifting, heartwarming, and positive.
- Prioritize stories that evoke feelings of hope, kindness, progress, or human achievement.

  * Acts of kindness and generosity by individuals or groups.
  * Positive scientific or technological breakthroughs that benefit humanity or the environment.
  * Heartwarming stories of animal welfare and rescue.

  * Any hint of negativity, tragedy, or conflict.
  * Stories focused on crime, accidents, or disasters (even with positive outcomes).
  * Political news (unless it's an overwhelmingly positive bipartisan achievement with clear benefits).
  * Business news focused solely on profit or market trends (unless it has a clear positive social impact).
  * Health news focused on illness or disease (unless it's a major breakthrough presented with strong hope).
  * Stories that feel like marketing or advertising.
  * Anything that could be perceived as sarcastic or ironic in a negative way.

CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEP (Apply these checks rigorously to both HEADLINE and SUMMARY BEFORE selecting an article):
For EACH article, perform a KEYWORD SEARCH and EMOTIONAL TONE ASSESSMENT in its HEADLINE and SUMMARY:
1. Does the HEADLINE or SUMMARY contain any keywords or context suggesting negativity, harm, or conflict? If YES, EXCLUDE.
2. Does the overall tone of the HEADLINE and SUMMARY feel genuinely uplifting and positive? If NO, EXCLUDE.
3. Does the story primarily focus on an act of kindness, a positive achievement, or a hopeful development? If NO, EXCLUDE.
4. Could the story be misconstrued as trivial or lacking genuine substance? If YES, EXCLUDE.
